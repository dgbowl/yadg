Given an experiment represented by a `schema`, **yadg** will process the files 
and folders specified in each experimental `step` of the `schema`, and produce a
`datagram` -- a unified data structure containing all measured ("raw") data in a 
given experiment. 

**yadg** also implements standardised processing of raw data, with features such as 
peak integration in chromatograms, quality factor determination from reflection 
coefficient traces, applying calibration curves to data, or simple numerical processing 
of tabular data. This "derived" data is systematically separated from the "raw" data.
