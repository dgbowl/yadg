**yadg** is a set of tools and parsers aimed to process raw instrument data. Given an experiment represented by a `dataschema`, **yadg** will process the files and folders specified in this `dataschema`, and produce a `datagram`, which is a unified data structure containing all measured ("raw") data in a given experiment. The `parsers` available in **yadg** are shown in the sidebar. As of ``yadg-5.0``, the `datagram` is stored as a |NetCDF|_ file. The produced `datagram` is associated with full provenance info, and the data within the `datagram` contain instrumental error estimates and are annotated with units. You can read more about **yadg** in our paper: [Kraus2022b]_.

   :alt: yadg is used to process raw data files using a datadchema into a NetCDF datagram.


Some of the **yadg** parsers are exposed via an `extractor` interface, allowing the user to extract (meta)-data from individual files without requiring a `dataschema`. Several file formats are supported, as shown in the sidebar. You can read more about this `extractor` interface on the |marda_extractors|_ website, as well as in the :ref:`Usage: Extractor mode<extractor mode>` section of this documentation.

.. warning::

   All of the post-processing features within **yadg** have been removed in ``yadg-5.0``, following their deprecation in ``yadg-4.2``. If you are looking for a post-processing library, have a look at |dgpost|_ instead.
