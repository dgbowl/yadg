  abstract = {Automation of experiments is a key component on the path of digitalisation in catalysis and related sciences. Here we present the lessons learned and caveats avoided during the automation of our contactless conductivity measurement set-up, capable of operando measurement of catalytic samples. We briefly discuss the motivation behind the work, the technical groundwork required, and the philosophy guiding our design. The main body of this work is dedicated to the detailing of the implementation of the automation, data structures, as well as the modular data processing pipeline. The open-source toolset developed as part of this work allows us to carry out unattended and reproducible experiments, as well as post-process data according to current best practice. This process is illustrated by implementing two routine sample protocols, one of which was included in the Handbook of Catalysis, providing several case studies showing the benefits of such automation, including increased throughput and higher data quality. The datasets included as part of this work contain catalytic and operando conductivity data, and are self-consistent, annotated with metadata, and are available on a public repository in a machine-readable form. We hope the datasets as well as the tools and workflows developed as part of this work will be an useful guide on the path towards automation and digital catalysis.},

  abstract = {The ``Seven Pillars'' of oxidation catalysis proposed by Robert K. Grasselli represent an early example of phenomenological descriptors in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Major advances in the theoretical description of catalytic reactions have been achieved in recent years and new catalysts are predicted today by using computational methods. To tackle the immense complexity of high-performance systems in reactions where selectivity is a major issue, analysis of scientific data by artificial intelligence and data science provides new opportunities for achieving improved understanding. Modern data analytics require data of highest quality and sufficient diversity. Existing data, however, frequently do not comply with these constraints. Therefore, new concepts of data generation and management are needed. Herein we present a basic approach in defining best practice procedures of measuring consistent data sets in heterogeneous catalysis using ``handbooks''. Selective oxidation of short-chain alkanes over mixed metal oxide catalysts was selected as an example.},
