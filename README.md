# ![yet another datagram](./docs/source/images/yadg_banner.png)

A set of tools to *extract* raw data from scientific instruments into standardised [`DataTree`](https://xarray-datatree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in-memory objects, or into [`NetCDF`](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) files on disk. The resulting data is annotated with metadata, provenance information, timestamps, units, and uncertainties. Currently developed at the [ConCat lab](https://www.tu.berlin/en/concat) at Technische Universität Berlin (Berlin, DE) and the [Materials for Energy Conversion](https://www.empa.ch/web/s501) lab at Empa (Dübendorf, CH).

### Capabilities:
- Extraction of **chromatography data** from gas and liquid chromatograms. Supports several Agilent, EZChrom, Masshunter, and Fusion formats.
- Extraction of **electrochemical data** from electrochemistry and battery cycling experiments. Supports BioLogic file formats.
- Extraction of **reflection coefficient** traces from network analysers. Supports the Touchstone file format.
- Extraction of **spectroscopy files** including common XPS, XRD and MS formats.
- Extraction of **tabulated data** using CSV parsing functionality, including Bronkhorst and DryCal output formats.

Additionally, data from multiple files of the same type, or even of different types, can be easily and reproducibly combined into a single `DataTree` by using *process* and *preset* modes of **yadg**.

### Features:
- timezone-aware timestamp processing using Unix timestamps
- locale-aware processing of files
- automatic uncertainty determination using data contained in the raw files, instrument specification, or last significant digit
- tagging of all data with units
- annotation with processing metadata (such as provenance or extraction date) under the `yadg_⋅⋅⋅` namespace
- original metadata from the extracted files is stored under `original_metadata`
- extensive *dataschema* validation using provided specifications

The full list of capabilities and features is listed in the [project documentation](http://dgbowl.github.io/yadg).

### Installation:
The released versions of `yadg` are available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) under [yadg](https://pypi.org/project/yadg). Those can be installed using:

```bash
pip install yadg
```

If you wish to install the current development version as an editable installation, check out the `main` branch using git, and install `yadg` as an editable package using pip:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dgbowl/yadg.git
cd yadg
pip install -e .
```

Additional targets `yadg[testing]` and `yadg[docs]` are available and can be specified in the above commands, if testing and/or documentation capabilities are required.

### Usage:
After installing `yadg`, you can extract data from single files of known filetypes using:

```bash
yadg extract <filetype> <infile> [outfile]
```

This will write the data extracted from the `infile` into a NetCDF file called `outfile`. An example usage for BioLogic MPR files would be:

```bash
yadg extract eclab.mpr example_file.mpr output_file.nc
```

Alternatively, you can obtain a `DataTree` object in Python via:

```python
import yadg
yadg.extractors.extract(filetype=<filetype>, path=<infile>)
```

More detailed [usage instructions](https://dgbowl.github.io/yadg/main/usage.html) are available in the project documentation.
