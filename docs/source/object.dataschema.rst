**yadg** `dataschema`
`````````````````````
A `dataschema` is an object defining the files and folders to be processed by 
yadg, as well as the types of parsers and the parser options to be applied.
One can think of a `dataschema` as a representation of a single experiment, 
containing measurements from multiple sources (or devices) and following a 
succession of experimental `steps`.

The current version of the `dataschema` is implemented as a Pydantic model in the 
class :obj:`~dgbowl_schemas.yadg.dataschema_4_1.DataSchema` of the :mod:`dgbowl_schemas.yadg`
module. Previous versions of the `dataschema` are available in the same repository:

- :class:`dgbowl_schemas.yadg.dataschema_4_1.DataSchema`
- :class:`dgbowl_schemas.yadg.dataschema_4_0.DataSchema`

An example is a simple catalytic test with a temperature ramp. The goal of such 
an experiment may be to measure the catalytic conversion as a function of 
temperature, and then calculate the activation energy of the catalytic reaction. 
The monitored devices and their filetypes are:

- the inlet flow and pressure meters -> ``csv`` data in ``foo.csv``
- the temperature controller -> ``csv`` data in ``bar.csv``
- the gas chromatograph -> Fusion ``json`` data in ``./GC/`` folder

Despite these three devices measuring concurrently, we would have to specify 
three separate `steps` in the schema to process all relevant output files:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "metadata": {
            "provenance": {
                "type": "manual"
            },
            "version": "4.1"
        },
        "steps": [{
            "parser": "basiccsv",
            "input": {"files": ["foo.csv"]},
            "tag": "flow",
        },{
            "parser": "basiccsv",
            "input": {"files": ["bar.csv"]}
        },{
            "parser": "chromtrace",
            "input": {"folders": ["./GC/"]},
            "parameters": {"filetype": "fusion.json"}
        }]
    }

.. note::

    Further information about the `dataschema` can be found in the documentation of 
    the :mod:`dgbowl_schemas.yadg` module.
