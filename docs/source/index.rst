**yadg** is a set of tools and parsers aimed to :ref:`extract<extractor mode>` and standardise data from raw files generated by scientific instruments. The supported types of files that can be extracted are listed in the sidebar. The data (or metadata) extracted from the supplied file is returned as a :class:`xarray.Dataset` or a |NetCDF|_ file.

For extracting and combining data from multiple files, **yadg** can be used to :ref:`process<parser mode>` a special configuration file called :mod:`~dgbowl_schemas.yadg.dataschema`. The combined data is returned as a :class:`datatree.DataTree` or a |NetCDF|_ file. This allows reproducible processing of structured experimental data, and takes care of issues such as timezone resolution, unit annotation, uncertainty determination, and keeps track of provenance.

For more details about **yadg** usage, see :ref:`the usage instructions<usage>`. You can read more about **yadg** in our paper: [Kraus2022b]_.
